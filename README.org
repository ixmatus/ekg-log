* Welcome!
  This library lets you send metrics gathered by the ekg family of
  packages (e.g. ekg-core and ekg) to a log for reading via a service
  plugin like [[http://serverdensity.com][Server Density]], piping to a pub/sub queue, or whatever
  you want.

* Getting started
  Exporting metrics to a log is simple, create an empty metric store
  and register some metrics:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  import System.Metrics
  import System.Remote.Monitoring.Statsd

  main = do
      store <- newStore
      registerGcMetrics store
      forkStatsd defaultStatsdOptions store
      ...
  #+END_SRC

  =forkEkgLog= starts a new thread that periodically appends your
  metrics to a specified log file.
